# Dawnbot

A Discord bot that provides the !tweet command, which will return and send the URL(s) of a given tweet's hidden images in the current message channel. This is to circumvent the current design of Discord's embedded tweets, which only display 1 image even if the tweet contains multiple images.

In order to use the bot, you will need to provide Twitter API keys in the `twitter_creditentials.json` file, and also replace the 'XXXXX' token variable with the token of your Discord bot.

maybe I'll add setup details later zzz
